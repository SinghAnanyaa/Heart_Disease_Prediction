# Heart_Disease_Prediction

This project develops and compares models for heart disease prediction through the various heart attributes of patient and detect impending heart
disease using Machine learning techniques , namely, Logistic Regression , Decision Tree , RandomForest and KNN Algorithm on the dateset available publicly in Kaggle Website, further evaluating the results using confusion matrix and cross validation. The highest accuracy score was given by Logistic Regression , which was 85.5%
